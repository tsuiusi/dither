# Dithering
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither

1. fs.py: Floyd-Steinberg Dithering

* Make this into a package, every dithering algorithm into a function
* Have a main.py that takes the function, filename, and produces the dithered picture

27/1/24 log:
* Convolution doesn't work
* Dithering does lfg
* Fix convolution, add more variables for FS dithering, add more dithering algorithms
* Clean up the .py
